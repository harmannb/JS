## Intermediate Javascript I 

* Debugging Javascript
	* Common JavaScript Errors
		* ReferenceError - occurs when we try to access a variable that does not exist in scope. 
		* TypeError - occurs when you make incorrect use of certain types in javascript. 
		* RangeError - occurs when we have a function that calls itself (also known as a recursive function). If we have too many functions that have been called (before they are returned) we run out of memmory and cause a RangeError. 
* Catching and Throwing Errors in Javascript
	*  Try / Catch Statement 
		* We place code inside of the try block (a block is defined as code inside of a {}) and if an error is thrown, the code moves to the catch block. 
	* In our try/catch statements, we can add one more special keyword called finally. Inside of the finally block, code will execute regardless of an error being thrown. 
	
	```
	try {
	    // let's randomly try to throw an error
	    if(Math.random() >= .5){
	        // The following code will throw:
	        // Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function(â€¦)
	        undefined();
	    }
	    console.log("Whew, we made it");
	} catch(e){
	   console.log("We didn't make it. The error message is", e.message);
	} finally {
	   console.log("No matter what we will see this statement");
	}
	```
