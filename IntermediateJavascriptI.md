## Intermediate Javascript I 

* Debugging Javascript
	* Common JavaScript Errors
		* ReferenceError - occurs when we try to access a variable that does not exist in scope. 
		* TypeError - occurs when you make incorrect use of certain types in javascript. 
		* RangeError - occurs when we have a function that calls itself (also known as a recursive function). If we have too many functions that have been called (before they are returned) we run out of memmory and cause a RangeError. 
* Catching and Throwing Errors in Javascript
